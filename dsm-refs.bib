abstract = {Statistics is a subject of many uses and surprisingly few effective practitioners. The traditional road to statistical knowledge is blocked, for most, by a formidable wall of mathematics. The approach in 'An Introduction to the Bootstrap' avoids that wall. It - exposes readers to many exciting and useful statistical techniques through real data examples, such as the mouse data, the stamp data, the tooth data and the hormone data; describes various techniques, including nonparametric regression, density estimation, classification trees, and least median squares regression; includes numerous exercises - some involving computing - that provide hands-on experience in applying the concepts and techniques; contains descriptions of a number of different computer programs for the methods discussed; offers a presentation accessible to non-specialists - scientists, engineers, and doctors - that will help them streamline their quantitative research.},
